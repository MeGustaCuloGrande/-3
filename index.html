        <h2 class="poslaniye2">
           I love you incredibly much, my one love.<br>
You're the best thing that happened in my life<br>
I'm so glad I met you.<br>
I hope we will always, always be together,<br>
you are the only one I want and maybe the last.<br>
Maybe you don't need everyone to love you,<br>
you just need one person.<br>
For me that person is you... <br>
I could never love another the way I love you<br>


I miss you all the time and sorry for everthing I did.<br>
decided to make this a message that you<br>
 will love it.<br>
